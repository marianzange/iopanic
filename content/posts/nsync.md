NSA is running the largest and most secure free backup service ever built. Still I couldn’t find any proper command-line backup tool to quickly compress and send my files to their service. So I’ve decided to introduce nsync:

**nsync is an easy to use bash command-line tool to backup your files to NSA’s fully secure and free backup servers.**

This is a very early version of nsync. Due to the robustness of NSA’s data collection and storage systems it should be very reliable though. I hope you find this little tool as useful as I do. Contributions are very welcome.
