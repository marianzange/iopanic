My blogs have changed quite often and I'm fairly sure I once wrote an article about dropping 
out of college and starting a company, but I can't seem to find it. Anyhow, a few years ago I had 
good reasons to turn my back to college studies and go my own way. I was working with good friends
on a great idea and I didn't like my college program. So I didn't hesitate much when I decided
to leave college and Germany and start a startup in Boston.

## Dropping Out Was The Most Valuable Experience

Looking back, even if none of our startups has *worked out* in the end, I feel like I've achieved more
than any other choice would've allowed. Leaving behind the rigid and standard system of education and
work allowed me to experiment, challenge myself, questioning everything and to ultimately gain a deeper 
understanding of things in our world are connected.

This experience has influenced the way I treat people, how I learn and what I think is important.

## Hooray, I'm An Undergrad Again!

It's actually less weird than it sounds. I really got used to facing situations where I'm the outlier and
move into different fields and push my learning curve.
