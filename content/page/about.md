My cat looks something like this. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows...

I'm a senior software consultant and devops expert with more than 10 years of experience. I'm mostly focused on architecting software and evolving its underlying infrastructure - both technical and human components. But I also do a lot of hands on work across the entire spectrum from mobile to algorithms. In the past I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups, the last one being <i>ezeep</i>, a cloud printing service (acquired by Cortado). Besides my work, one of my main interests is high energy physics, especially neutrino physics.

If you have an interesting project you want to discuss, just let me know and I'll get in touch with you.
