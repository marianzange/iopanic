*In spirit of the fundamental human desire to reach beyond the obvious, my mission is to help evolving collaboration in science and technology.*

I'm an entrepreneur and technical lead with more than 10 years of experience. I'm co-founder and technical researcher at <a href="https://www.5to3.io">5to3</a>, a non-profit dedicated to improving the scientific process and preservation and safeguarding of research data for future generations.

Past companies I've co-founded include Berlin based ezeep, a cloud managed printing service for education and enterprises (acquired by Cortado AG) and Liquid Labs, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing - primarily text summarization and clustering. I've also been involved in a variety of other projects in both, software engineering and consulting roles.
