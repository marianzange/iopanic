My cat looks something like this. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows...

I'm a freelance software engineer and devops expert with more than 10 years of experience. I'm mostly focused on architecting complex systems and processes. But I also do a lot of hands on coding across the entire spectrum from mobile to algorithms. In the past I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups, the last one being <i>ezeep</i>, a cloud printing service (acquired by Cortado). Besides my work, one of my main interests is high energy physics, especially neutrino physics.

I'm currently not available to join any projects, but feel free to contact me. You never know what the future might bring. And please, be one of the cool kids and use my PGP key.
