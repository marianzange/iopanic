## Marian Zange

I study geoscience at <a href="http://www.tum.edu">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> and build software. 
Before joining TUM, I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups (the last one being ezeep). 
Besides studying and building software, I'm co-founder of Crashpad, a co-living and co-working community for climbers and technologists.
