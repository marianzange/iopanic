My cat looks something like this. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows...

I study geoscience and physics at <a href="http://www.tum.edu">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> and <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de">Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU)</a>. I can get pretty excited about anything physics related, especially if it involves quantum mechanics and particle physics.

Before going back to university to have fun with physics, I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups (the last one being ezeep). Besides studying I'm a freelance software engineer and technical product lead.
