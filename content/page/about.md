*In spirit of the fundamental human desire to reach beyond the obvious, my mission is to help evolving collaboration in science and technology.*

I'm an entrepreneur and technical lead with more than 10 years of experience. My current venture is taking shape quickly, but is still unannounced. Check back soon to see what we've been up to.

Past companies I've co-founded include Berlin based ezeep, a cloud managed printing service for education and enterprises which was acquired by Cortado AG. And Liquid Labs, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing, primarily text summarization and clustering. I've also been involved in a variety of other projects in both, software engineering and consulting roles.
