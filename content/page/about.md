My cat looks something like this. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows...

I'm a freelance software engineer and devops expert with more than 10 years of experience. I'm mostly focused on architecting complex systems and processes. But I also do a lot of hands on coding across the entire spectrum from mobile to algorithms. In the past I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups, the last one being <i>ezeep</i>, a cloud printing service (acquired by Cortado).

Besides my work, I study physics at <a href="http://www.tum.edu">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> and <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de">Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU)</a>. My main interest is in the area of high energy physics, especially neutrino physics. If you can tell from which physics book I've copied my whiteboard cat, I might buy you a muon flavored ice cream.

I'm currently not available to join any projects, but feel free to contact me. You never know what the future might bring. And please, be one of the cool kids and use my PGP key.
