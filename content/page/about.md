## Marian Zange

I study geoscience and physics at <a href="http://www.tum.edu">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de">Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU)</a>. 
Before going back to university to have fun with physics, I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups (the last one being ezeep). 

Besides studying I'm a freelance software engineer and technical product lead and
co-founder of Crashpad, a co-living and co-working community for climbers and technologists.
