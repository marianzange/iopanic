My name is Marian Zange, I’m a software consultant and engineer. My work is mostly focused on complex systems, infrastructure and managing software engineering organizations. Besides this, I'm co-founder of <a href="https://www.5to3.io">5to3</a>, a non-profit dedicated to improving the scientific process and the preservation and safeguarding of research data by bridging the gap between classical institutional trust models and decentralized systems.

Past companies I've co-founded include <a href="http://www.ezeep.com">ezeep</a>, a cloud printing service for education and businesses (acquired by ThinPrint) and <a href="https://angel.co/liquid-labs">Liquid Labs</a>, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing - primarily text summarization and clustering. I've also been involved in a variety of other projects in both, software engineering and consulting roles.
