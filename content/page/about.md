My cat looks something like this. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows...

![Schroedinger's cat feeding on top quarks](/images/particle_disposal.jpg)

I study geoscience and physics at <a href="http://www.tum.edu">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uni-muenchen.de">Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU)</a>. 
Before going back to university to have fun with physics, I've co-founded several venture capital backed technology startups (the last one being ezeep). 

Besides studying I'm a freelance software engineer and technical product lead and
co-founder of Crashpad, a co-living and co-working community for climbers and technologists.

If you want to learn more about my vita, feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile or just google my name if you really want to be one of the creepy people.
