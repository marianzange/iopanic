        According to a fellow student, a general assumption exists, stating that almost no article on Wikipedia is more than five degrees seperated from the article about Adolf Hitler. To verify this assumption, I have analyzed the German Wikipedia and computed the shortest distance between all vertices and the vertex representing the article about Adolf Hitler. The result shows that 97.1% of all articles have a path length of ≤ 5.

        As a kid, you probably looked at things and often asked yourself: Why? Why does my water pistol transform this lazy thing called water into a pressurized stream I can aim at my cat? And why is my cat not enjoying the free shower? When we look at the physical world, we see amazing things all the time. Laws of nature are repeatable. Everything we do is based on the understanding that a natural law is applicable anywhere in our universe.

        I&rsquo;ve seen hell, when it comes to software development and actual production environments. Inconsitent platforms, packages and a plethora of hacks to &lsquo;get everything to work&rsquo; on all developer machines. I&rsquo;ve seen whole teams screwing with a shared &lsquo;dev database&rsquo; on a root server somewhere, creating a horrible mess of inconsistent behavior and ultimately slow down development and testing. This article will give you an overview how you can use Docker and Dusty to streamline your dev environments.

        For all of you who haven’t noticed yet, I’ve left ezeep at the end of December. As a co-founder it’s been a tough decision to leave, after joining forces with my two amazing co-founders nearly three years ago. Looking back, building ezeep was an incredible and fun challenge.
However, I started to feel that the direction ezeep is moving into and my own passions were drifting apart and that someone else would be able to fulfill the changed requirements much better than me.

    <section class="li-article-section">
        NSA is running the largest and most secure free backup service ever built. Still I couldn’t find any proper command-line backup tool to quickly compress and send my files to their service. So I’ve decided to introduce nsync:
nsync is an easy to use bash command-line tool to backup your files to NSA’s fully secure and free backup servers.
This is a very early version of nsync. Due to the robustness of NSA’s data collection and storage systems it should be very reliable though.

        Gaining Certainty Through Abstraction Technology has always shaped how we interact with the world and the people around us. Let’s start off with a very simple example: When the first bridges were built, the engineering part was a great achievement, but the idea of building a bridge is less about solving engineering problems just for the sake of solving them. Building a bridge is in it’s very essential core about connecting people.
