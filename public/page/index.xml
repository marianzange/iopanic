      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m co-founder and technical researcher at 5to3, a non-profit dedicated to improving the scientific process and the preservation and safeguarding of research data for future generations. My current work focus is on researching resilient, decentralized protocols to enable stable mixed environments that combine classic institutional trust models with trustless, highly distributed systems.
Past companies I&amp;rsquo;ve co-founded include ezeep, a cloud printing service for education and enterprises (acquired by Cortado AG) and Liquid Labs, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing - primarily text summarization and clustering.</description>
