      <description>Iâ€™m a freelance technical consultant and software engineer, focused on complex systems, infrastructure and software engineering operations. Besides this, I&amp;rsquo;m co-founder of 5to3, a non-profit dedicated to improving the scientific process and the preservation and safeguarding of research data. With 5to3, I&amp;rsquo;m researching decentralized protocols that allow elevating classic institutional trust models into trustless and self-governed systems.
Past companies I&amp;rsquo;ve co-founded include ezeep, a cloud printing service for education and enterprises (acquired by Cortado AG) and Liquid Labs, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing - primarily text summarization and clustering.</description>
