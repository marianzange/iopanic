      <description>In spirit of the fundamental human desire to reach beyond the obvious, my mission is to help evolving collaboration in science and technology.
I&amp;rsquo;m an entrepreneur and technical lead with more than 10 years of experience. My current venture is taking shape quickly, but is still unannounced. Check back soon to see what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to.
Past companies I&amp;rsquo;ve co-founded include Berlin based ezeep, a cloud managed printing service for education and enterprises which was acquired by Cortado AG.</description>
