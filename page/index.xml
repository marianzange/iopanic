      <description>My name is Marian Zange, Iâ€™m a software consultant and engineer. My work is mostly focused on complex systems, infrastructure and managing software engineering organizations. Besides this, I&amp;rsquo;m co-founder of 5to3, a non-profit dedicated to improving the scientific process and the preservation and safeguarding of research data by bridging the gap between classical institutional trust models and decentralized systems.
Past companies I&amp;rsquo;ve co-founded include ezeep, a cloud printing service for education and businesses (acquired by ThinPrint) and Liquid Labs, a formerly Cambridge, MA based startup focused on natural language processing - primarily text summarization and clustering.</description>
