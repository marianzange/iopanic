      <description>This article assumes that you&amp;rsquo;re generally familiar with Docker, Amazon IAM, Travis CI and some basic bash scripting.I used to use Quay as a private registry but found that when heavily relying on AWS just using ECR gets the job done nicely and is a bit cheaper. However, AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you a build environment like Quay does. So you have several options: Setting up your own, pushing images from the developer machine or simply using your already existing CI infrastructure to build and push your images.</description>
